# CuttleFish_Malware

Cuttlefish is an advanced malware that targets enterprise environments, leveraging sophisticated techniques to bypass traditional security measures such as network segmentation and endpoint monitoring. It is particularly notorious for its ability to dwell undetected within cloud infrastructures, making it a persistent threat to data security. Cuttlefish exploits weak credentials and can perform suspicious activities that mimic legitimate user behavior, thereby avoiding detection. Its capabilities include bypassing geofencing and ASN-based blocks, often using residential IP addresses to blend in with normal traffic. Organizations are advised to enhance their security posture by implementing strict credential management, monitoring login activities, and encrypting all sensitive network traffic.
